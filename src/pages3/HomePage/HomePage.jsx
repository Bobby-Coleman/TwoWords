            Thinking of good ideas is hard. Preconscieved notions about
            the world can get in the way. Two Words will allow new thoughts to be formed and
            new ideas born. Flip through each pairing of random words.
            Let your thoughts wander and write down whatever comes to mind, 
            and remember, donâ€™t think too hard.
