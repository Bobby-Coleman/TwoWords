        <p className="home-intro">The greatest asset humankind holds is our ability to be irrational. 
            It is this ability - to be totally and completely nonsensical - 
            that is the fertilizer in which the best ideas can grow. 
            Two Words dives headfirst into the absurd by presenting two entirely unrelated words,
            so that new connections may be formed, and new inventions born.
            Take a minute to look at each pairing of random words.
            Let your thoughts wander and write down whatever comes to mind, 
            and remember, donâ€™t think too hard.
